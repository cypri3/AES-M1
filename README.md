## AES Implementation Project for Cryptography Course

This project entails the comprehensive implementation of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) in the C programming language. Guided by course material and standard documentation, the project begins with a thorough understanding of the AES standard (FIPS-197), developing functional encryption and decryption algorithms for single-block processing using 128-bit keys. Subsequent stages expand functionality to support various text and key sizes, along with implementing multiple modes of operation such as ECB, CBC, CFB, OFB, and GCM, adaptable to key sizes of 128, 192, or 256 bits as selected by the user. Emphasis is placed on clear documentation, code readability, and addressing encountered challenges through the accompanying report, which includes user instructions, testing scripts, implementation insights, and solutions to overcome hurdles faced during development.

## Introduction

### Project Overview

This project aims to develop a robust and optimized implementation of the AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) symmetric encryption algorithm, widely used to secure digital data. The primary goal is to provide a high-performance version of AES supporting encryption and decryption of files efficiently and securely, integrating multiple AES modes of operation: ECB, CBC, CFB, and GCM. Special focus is given to optimizing the ECB mode for performance evaluation.

### Context

Developed in an academic setting, this AES project serves learning and research purposes. While rigorous, it may contain imperfections or bugs due to its experimental nature. The development was a collaborative effort, enhancing our understanding and skills in version control systems like Git, which was essential for coordinating work, tracking changes, and maintaining project organization.

## Usage Guide

### Downloading and Compiling

To use the AES project, download the source files and compile the program using the following steps:

#### Downloading the Source Code

```sh
git clone https://github.com/cypri3/AES-M1.git
```

#### Compiling the Project & Cleaning Compiled Files

Ensure GCC is installed on your system. Compile the project by running the following command in the project's root directory:
```sh
make all
```
This command will compile all necessary source files and generate the AES binary. To clean your working directory by removing all object files and the generated binary, use:
```sh
make clean
```

### User Instructions

The AES program allows encrypting and decrypting files using various encryption modes (ECB, CBC, CFB, GCM) with a user-specified key. Hereâ€™s how to use different functionalities:

#### Encryption and Decryption

Example commands for encryption and decryption using different AES modes:
```sh
./AES -m ECB original.txt
./AES -m CBC original.txt
./AES -m CFB original.txt
./AES -m GCM original.txt
```

Commands with output files:
```sh
./AES -c -o encrypted.txt original.txt
./AES -d -o decrypted.txt encrypted.txt

```

For batch processing multiple texts:
```sh
./AES original1.txt original2.txt
```

#### Generating a Random Key

Generate a random key of the desired size (128, 192, 256 bits) and save it to a file:
```sh
./AES -g 256 -o generated_key.txt
```

Use generated keys as follows:
```sh
./AES -k 0x000102030405060708090a0b0c0d0e0f original.txt
```

#### Exporting to a File

Specify an output file for encryption or decryption results:
```sh
./AES -g 128 -m ECB -o encrypted.txt original.txt
```

#### Benchmarking

To evaluate encryption performance over 100 iterations:
```sh
./AES -b
```

Run a benchmark on a specific file:
```sh
./AES -b anotherfile.txt
```

#### Additional Options

  ```
- **Initialization Vector**: Specify an initialization vector for modes like CBC, CFB, and GCM:
  ```sh
  ./AES -m CBC -i 0x00000000000000000000000000000001 -o out.txt in.txt
  ```
- **Authentication Data, Tag, and Increment**: For GCM mode, specify authentication data, a validation tag, and an increment value:
  ```sh
  ./AES -m GCM -a 0x00000000000000000000000000000001 -t 0x0a0b0c0d0e -i 0x01 -o out.txt in.txt
